# How to View the GUI Application

## Understanding GUI Display

A GUI (Graphical User Interface) application shows windows with buttons, text, and graphics on your **screen**. This requires a display connection between your application and your monitor.

## Current Situation

You're running in a **headless environment** (like Cursor's cloud workspace), which doesn't have direct access to a display screen. That's why you see the error.

## Solutions Based on Your Setup

### ? **Option 1: Run Locally on Your Computer** (Easiest)

If you have Python installed on your **local computer** (Windows/Mac/Linux), run it there:

```bash
# 1. Download the project files to your local machine
# 2. Open terminal on your local computer
# 3. Navigate to project folder
cd /path/to/AI-NLP-Analysis-and-Stock-Data-Script

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Configure .env file with your API key

# 6. Run the GUI
python gui_app.py
```

**Result:** A window will pop up on your local screen showing:
- Stock data panel (left)
- Sentiment summary (right)
- News articles tab
- Buttons at the bottom

---

### ? **Option 2: Use X11 Forwarding** (For SSH connections)

If you're connecting to a remote Linux server via SSH:

```bash
# Connect with X11 forwarding enabled
ssh -X username@remote-server

# On the remote server, run:
python gui_app.py
```

**Result:** GUI window appears on your local computer's screen (forwarded through SSH).

---

### ? **Option 3: Use Virtual Display (Xvfb)** (For headless servers)

For servers without a screen, create a virtual display:

```bash
# Install Xvfb
sudo apt-get install xvfb

# Run GUI with virtual display
xvfb-run -a python gui_app.py
```

**Note:** This creates the GUI but you still can't see it. You'd need VNC or X11 forwarding to view it.

---

### ? **Option 4: Use VNC** (For remote viewing)

Set up VNC server to view the GUI remotely:

```bash
# Install VNC server
sudo apt-get install tigervnc-standalone-server

# Start VNC server
vncserver :1

# Connect with VNC client from your local machine
# Then run: DISPLAY=:1 python gui_app.py
```

---

### ? **Option 5: Use CLI Version** (No GUI needed)

The command-line version works perfectly in any environment:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Result:** Clean, formatted text output in your terminal showing:
- Stock data
- News articles with sentiment
- Overall summary
- Option to export to JSON

## For Your Current Environment (Cursor Cloud Workspace)

**Best approach:** Download the project and run it locally on your computer.

**Alternative:** Use the CLI version (`python main.py`) which provides the same functionality with beautiful terminal output - no display needed!

---

## Quick Test

To test if you have a display available:

```bash
# Check if DISPLAY is set
echo $DISPLAY

# If nothing prints, you're in a headless environment
# Use Option 1 (local) or Option 5 (CLI)
```

## Summary

| Environment | Solution | Can See GUI? |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| Local computer | Run `python gui_app.py` | ? Yes |
| Remote server via SSH | Use `ssh -X` then run GUI | ? Yes |
| Headless server | Use CLI: `python main.py` | ? No (but terminal output works) |
| Cursor/VS Code remote | Download and run locally | ? Yes (on local) |
| Docker container | Set up X11 forwarding | ? Yes (with setup) |

**Recommendation:** Since you're in a remote environment, either:
1. **Download and run locally** for the GUI experience
2. **Use `python main.py`** for the terminal experience (works great!)
